# Challenge 3 JavaScript Password Generator
This week's challenge requires the developer to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. 

## User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data <br />
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria <br />
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security <br />

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password <br />
WHEN I click the button to generate a password <br />
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria <br />
WHEN prompted for password criteria<br />
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br />
WHEN prompted for the length of the password<br />
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br />
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password<br />
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br />
WHEN I answer each prompt<br />
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br />
WHEN all prompts are answered<br />
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br />
WHEN the password is generated<br />
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br />
